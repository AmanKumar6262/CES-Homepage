    <h2>Civil Engineering Society</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <P>About the society, Civil Engineering Society was established in 2008 by the student of NIT Jamshedpur. This was the result of eager dameanor of several civil engineers who are looking for a common platform for the civil engineers all around country, to share their views and ideas. The working approach of CES is very lucid. It basically regroups the persons, with different ideologies, who have travelled a common path of civil engineering. We have first year as well as alumni of 90s batch in our member list thereby creating a common stage for younkers and Big Daddy of this field. This experience difference nourishes the young ones a lot and guides them through the complexities. Thus society has evolved a pretty new creed of Learning from the Learned Ones.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Here in the society, members and students of Civil engineering branch</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Discuss over several topics</li>
            <li>put forward their innovative ideas </li>
            <li>compete to take the best out of them (by participating in tests conducted)</li>
            <li>get an access to various e-books, latest facts about civil engineering </li>
            <li>aid by their seniors in achieving internships, sponsorships etc. and many more things</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>CES, till now has done appreciable works for the advancement of its students and will be continuing the same in future too. Rather than society, it has developed into a big, very big family where every younger is taken care of by their elders. A great thanks to its founding fathers from the each fortunate member of the society. </p>
